            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen Religion shews it self in its Native Dress and Lustre, neither disguised by the Vice, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, nor Complexion of its Votaries, it is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to the greatest Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Fortune, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="tcp:37383:4"/> a Beauty and Greatness so attractive &amp; commanding, that nothing can resist. A truth of which, your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Exemplary, yet easie and becoming Piety, has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so great an instance and certain proof to the World; that had I been left free from all other Obligations, would have determin'd my choice in this Dedication: As not knowing to whom, more properly to dedicate a Book of Devotion, than to one who has done so
<pb facs="tcp:37383:4"/> much Right, not to say Honour to Religion, as to reconcile all the heights of the strictest Piety, to the decency and easiness, and all that's valuable in the sweetest Temper, and most indearing Conversation.</p>
            <p>But what is thus made my choice, is an act of Justice and Duty too; for what I presume now to offer, was on many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts before your own; and as in the first design it was devoted to your
<pb facs="tcp:37383:5"/> Service and Assistance, so by long attendance on your Closet, it prescribes to the honour of being reputed yours; and as the change of Dress cannot lessen your Title, so I am assur'd your goodness is such, as will heighten your value of it, for being in a capacity to be more useful. In confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence whereof, I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume of your Pardon and Acceptance, and inlarge no farther, but to beseech Almighty God long to
<pb facs="tcp:37383:5"/> continue your Ladyship, a Blessing and Honour to your Family, a true Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Charity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, a great Example of Virtue, Devotion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Blessings on your Self, your Family, and Relations, Reward and Crown your Piety. Which as it is the common Prayer of all that have the honour to know your Ladyship, is in a more especial and particular manner, of him,

            <p>THE greatest part of the following Devotions being wrote many years since, and dispersed in several Copies; it was not in my power wholly to prevent their being publick: nor any other way to secure my self from being accountable for the mistakes of a Copy, than by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming so far on the Charity of the World, as to permit the Publication, I could never be certain to prevent. If they answer the end to which they are design'd, there will need no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse; and if they do not, 'tis yet so pardonable, but to attempt to assist
<pb facs="tcp:37383:7"/> the Devotion of well-disposed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that they will at least forgive it. And as for those who have so little sense of Religion, that they cannot attend publick Devotions, but with such rudeness and indecency, as carry the most certain marks of uneasiness and disregard; as there is no reason to expect their Candour, there is none to regard their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>

                     <p>'TIS not the Christian's business to dispute, whether Nature, or Revelation, first taught the World to celebrate his Praise, who gave a being to it, by keeping one day holy. Whether the Patriarchs had stated times of Worship, or whether the Command given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to keep one day Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were the re-inforcing of an old, or the giving of a new Law. Whether that Law does oblige us to Consecrate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37383:8"/> One Day in Seven, or render one Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of our time the certain right of Heaven? 'Tis enough that the Miracles and Blessings of a Saviour's Resurrection, that the descent of the Holy Ghost, and probably some particular Directions of our Great Master, did so soon Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate this Day, that in St. <hi>John</hi>'s time it was well known by the Name of the <hi>Lords Day;</hi> and its Observation as a part of our common Christianity spread through the Christian World, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived together with the Gospel, and by a prescription almost as ancient as Christianity, this day challenges the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Tributes of Adoration and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to our Great Creator. This may therefore be concluded, the Day which the Lord hath made; and in a more especial manner, His Day; and it is but Justice to give to God the things which are his, and devote this Day to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and a fit Subject for our Care, that a mistaken Zeal may not change the <hi>Christian,</hi> to a <hi>Jewish</hi> Sabbath; nor a notion too loose, reduce it only to a day of leisure: But this is then a Day truly Holy to the Lord, when the Church has our Presence, and God our
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37383:8"/> Hearts; when Union gives Courage to our Addresses, and every Christian lends the heats of a holy Zeal, to inspirit the Publick Prayers, and carry them up to Heaven; and united Devotions with a holy violence, force their entrance thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Among such as thus keep Holy Day, let me go to the House of God; let me not trifle, nor sport, nor sleep this holy time away. Let not Mammon impose necessities upon me; nor any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Interest invade the right of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but let a publick, serious, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected Piety, and all the useful Offices of Friendship, and Charity, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, attend and Crown it, and let me never be ashamed thus to confess my Lord before Men.</p>

                     <p>SUch is our eagerness in the pursuit of Worldly Blessings, that our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions make but a short Parenthesis in our time and business; and we are restless and uneasie till we fly back to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of our Mammon. Thus he that gives us our Being, and our Time, is stinted to a Day; nay, how oft is it that our greedy desires assault him in his Sanctuary, intrench upon his Right, and our worldly thoughts observe no day of Rest? But when we dare take so much courage, as to divide betwixt God and Mammon, and notwithstanding the importunities of the World, yield one day back to our great Creator; yet then with what greediness do we return to our wonted drudgery in the service of the World, and grudge, and think we are injured, if a single quarter be spent upon a Prayer; and our Devotion is thought rude, if it ask a few minutes from the importunate world. Wretched

How happy might we be, did we believe we served our selves, by serving of our God, and by the same methods carry on our Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Eternal Interest; that Prayer prospers our business, and that of the Closet helps dispatch in all other affairs: <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

A sad and fatal proof that in our Corrupted State no Chains will hold the unruly Fiend; for if in the State of Innocence Sin were able to break in upon the World, and in Paradise it self invade Mankind, how shall we now resist the Strong Man Armed? Armed by this great debauch of Humane Nature, by the early possession of Vice, and habits of Sin well nigh as old as our being; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits which make the same Seed of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin, bring forth in some Ten, in some Fifty, in others an Hundred Fold. That is indeed the Cockatrices Egg, but it is our own habits that nurse it into Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents: 'tis the Sin of our immediate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that renders the Sin of our first so dangerous, and the want of a timely care to instil the holy Rules of Vertue, that gives Sin so universal a Dominion in the World. For what reason is able to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Vice incorporated into Nature, indeared by custom, and by long usage become familiar. In these unhappy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, who can wonder if men be governed by the Law in the Members, when they must take leave of what Sin
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37383:23"/> has made dear, put off a part of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and subdue their very Natures, before they can heartily set forward in the way to Heaven; and when they do, there is hardship to conquer, and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to struggle with; for the brightest Soul (like <hi>Israel</hi>'s Cloud) has some dark side, some part or passion, that is less guarded than all the rest. And he that is proof against the most powerful assaults of a bare faced Vice (like the strongest Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) may be taken by surprise. One Glance may let in an Adultery repulsed a Thousand times by serious Thoughts; and one Passion transport the best of Men, to the commission of what they again abhor when cooled into their usual Temper. O wretched Men that we are! Who shall deliver us from this Body of Death? Whither can we fly? but to him that has conquered Death for us, to him that assumed our Natures without our Corruption; 'tis he that must redeem us from the Tyranny and Dominion of it, and he that was tempted, and yet knew no Sin, he only can deliver us from the Power and Prevalence of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; his Grace may be sufficient for us, and through his Strength we may do all

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>BEsides those who neglect the publick Service of the Church for want of a due Sense of Religion, there are too many led into the like neglect, upon an Opinion that their own private Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are as prevalent and acceptable with God, as those of the publick. Or else, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That to read and pray in their own Families on the Lord's Day, is all the Duty that Day requires, and God expects from them. And these are the Snares with which the great Enemy to Peace and Holiness deludes many well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning People in these Kingdoms; and makes the publick Service of God so shamefully neglected. The first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is so directly opposite to the Spirit and Temper of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Gospel,
<pb facs="tcp:37383:76"/> that teach us to be meek and lowly, to that Charity that vaunteth not it self, and is not puffed up; and to that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Meekness which are the Fruit of the Spirit; that it may be safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, 'tis the Fruits of spiritual pride. Nor is the second pretence better ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for there is no one thing in which the Christian World is more unanimous, than in asserting it our Duty to set apart a portion of our time for the publick Service of God; and declaring that to be God's publick Service, when the Congregation met in some publick place, joins together to pray unto, and to praise God. This is that Worship of God for which the Seventh Day under the Law was, and the first under the Gospel, is now set apart. And as he would have been thought an ill <hi>Jew,</hi> that did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect to present himself on their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, in the Temple, or the Synagogue, to bear a part in the Worship injoyned by his Religion: So they ought to be accounted ill <hi>Christians,</hi> that neglect
<pb facs="tcp:37383:76"/> the publick Worship of God, on the Lord's Day more especially, and in that publick manner which the Christians of all Ages have ever practised, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Duty laid upon them by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion. For our Christianity does as strictly oblige us to the Tributes of a publick Adoration and Praise, due to Almighty God, as the great Lord and Governour of the World, as to the secret Piety and Devotion which have no other Witnesses than God and our own Hearts: Nor is that a Duty only, but a Favour and a Blessing too; a Blessing every good <hi>Christian</hi> ought to value, and to manifest that Value by a sedulous Attendance upon God's publick Worship, and a reverent and devout Behaviour therein. Let me therefore intreat all such persons, into whose hands the ensuing Devotions fall, never so far to mistake me, nor themselves, as to think any thing else intended therein, but to assist them in their private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses to Almighty God, when they
<pb facs="tcp:37383:77"/> want opportunity more publickly to serve him; and to judge so modestly of their own Devotions, however frequent or serious, that they may never hinder them from the publick, and therefore more honourable Service of God; and as you tender the Honour of God, and the Interest of the Church and Religion established in these Kingdoms, let not your remisness in coming to publick Prayers, nor your irreverence at them, be a Stumbling-Block to those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, nor an offence to those who own the Communion of this Church; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it a Duty which lies upon you, to make use of every Opportunity to join in the publick Service of the Church; and be as serious, affectionate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, when you are praying therein for common Blessings, as when you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating God for the necessities of your own Soul; and do not think your Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, whatever it be, sufficient to excuse any indecency in the Service of God, but rather an obligation to give a good
<pb facs="tcp:37383:77"/> Example to others; but for whispering, and talking, and rude and indecent Gestures, and all irreverent Behaviour in the Church, during the Time of Prayers, look upon them, as in truth they are, publick Affronts to God and the Religion established; and as you tender the Honour of God and his Church, carefully avoid them; but when you want opportunity publickly to serve God, the Composures of private Men may be useful; those which follow are therefore wrote under the Title of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for several persons, or a whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, to accomodate such whose intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and dearness, makes them sollicitous to joyn together even in their private Devotions; and assist those, who by any natural inability cannot, or by some present Aversion, or Indisposition, are unfit to read, and so are uncapable of the Benefit of any other Devotions or Prayers but such as may be read to them by others. If the Prayers fixed to the Days of the Week are thought too short,
<pb facs="tcp:37383:78"/> there is a longer Form of Morning and Evening Prayer; or there are Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the Church, or the King, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Graces, which may be added and used together with them as in discretion you think fit.</p>

                     <p>O Eternal God, in whom we live, and move, and have our Being, and to whom we owe the uttermost Service, that our corrupted Natures render us capable of performing; be pleased to assist us in the Holy Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of this Day, and in thy Mercy accept them: Since thou hast vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to carry us through the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the past Night, let the fame Providence protect us in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of this Day; and the Spirit
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:37383:79"/> of Wisdom so direct us, that in all our Works continued and ended in thee, we may glorifie thy holy Name: Since thou hast vouchsafed to give us thy Gospel, and to bring Life and Immortality to Light, yet hast not dealt so with many other Nations, nor given them Knowledge of thy Laws; Let not our Ingratitude render us unworthy of so great a Blessing, nor our Lust ever so far prevail as to make that Mercy become a Snare, or force us to choose Darkness rather than Light, because our Deeds are evil; but let thy Grace so accompany thy Gospel, that it may be a Light to our Feet, and a Lanthorn to our Paths; and by thy Almighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a happy Instrument of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>For this, end take from us all Blindness and hardness of Heart, all Tenderness and Affection to Sin; open our Understandings to see the wondrous things of thy Law, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:37383:79"/> set our Affections on things above. Let not the Dulness of our own Hearts render thy Gospel fruitless, nor the Cares of this World, or the Deceitfulness of Riches choak the good Seed of thy Word. Let there be no Enemy to sow Tares, but make the Ground good, and let it bring forth an Hundred Fold: Let thy Spirit go with us to the House of Prayer, and purge away those Lusts that make it a Den of Thieves, that our publick Services may be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in thy sight, O Lord our Strength and our Redeemer. Good God, hear us, and answer us, and do more for us than we are able to ask or think, for his sake who sits at thy Right Hand to make Intercession for us, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> the Righteous, to whom, with thee, and thy blessed Spirit, be ascribed all Honour, and Glory, and Praise, and Adoration, both now and for evermore, </p>

                     <p>O Almighty God, who art always more ready to hear than we to pray, and to give more than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we desire or deserve; be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to accept our Sacrifices of Praise and Thanksgiving for the Mercies thou hast this Day vouchsafed unto us: For the glad Tidings of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Peace, for inviting us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and live, and calling upon us to make our Peace with Heaven; be pleased to add one Blessing more to all the rest thou bestowest upon us, that is, Hearts so truly sensible of all thy Mercies, that thy Calls may awake us from our Sleep in Sin, and thy Word be quick and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in searching our deceitful Hearts, that a secret Guilt may not escape, nor a darling Sin resist it; but let the Balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> heal all our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies; build us up in our holy
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:37383:80"/> Faith; let that Faith work by Love; that Love so manifest it self in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Commandments, that we may enter into Life. And that thy Word may not fall among Briars and Thorns, nor thy preaching in our Streets rise in Judgment against us; be graciously pleased that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Influence of thy Blessed Spirit may constantly attend it, and bring it home to all our Souls. Let the same Hand that plants, give the Increase, &amp; the same Mercy that gives the Seed prepare the Soil, and let the Increase be an hundred Fold; that the Light of thy Gospel that shines round, may point out all our Failings, and shew us what the Lord would have us to do; may teach us to make it our great Business to enquire what we must do to be saved; and kindle such a Zeal as may hasten our Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number of thy Faithful

Yet lest our Guilt should defeat our Hopes and Prayers, and thy Word fall like Showrs or Seed upon a Rock, that neither mollifie nor bring forth Fruit; and our Sins cry loud enough to make us deaf to the Voice of the Charmer; For thy Mercy's sake (O Lord) heal our Backslidings, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our Sins; forget our Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pass by our numberless Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and magnifie thy Power in shewing Mercy and Pity; Spare us, good Lord, O spare thy People whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious Bloud; reward us not according to our Iniquities, but let thy Mercy surmount all our Sins, and thy Goodness triumph in the Pardon of all our Follies. O thou merciful Preserver of Mankind, who sparest when we deserve Punishment, and in the midst of thy Wrath thinkest upon Mercy; extend that Mercy to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:37383:81"/> all our Works; and forgive us the Sins even of our holy things. Let not our Carelesness or our Coldness, our Unpreparedness or our Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in hearing of thy Word, nor any one of those Impieties we have this Day added to our great account, prevent thy Mercy, or keep back a full and free Pardon of all our Sins: But let thy Son's Merits hide us from thy Vengeance, and cover us in the Day of Wrath. Good Lord, let the same Mercy that has this Day protected us, be our Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary and Protection through the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the ensuing Night; and the same Goodness that has this day fed our Souls, this Night refresh our Bodies; and keep us safe from Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and Danger, from sad Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Sin, that we may once more praise thee in the Land of the Living; and by adding time to the day of our Repentance, we may be so prepared, that when our Lord shall

                     <p>Lord be merciful to thy People wherever dispersed, or however di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed; in Righteousness establish the King's Throne, and his Scepter

Defend the Cause of the Fatherless and the Widow, and see that the poor and needy have their right. Reward all our Benefactors a thousand-fold into their Bosoms; bless all our Friends, and forgive our Enemies! Bless us also, O our Father, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate our selves before thee, to praise and magnifie thy holy Name for all thy mercies from day to day bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us! for thy care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection the past Night, and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thou hast this morning renewed upon us.

O do thou be pleased to make us thy people, and delight in doing us good; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy great goodness have mercy on us. O Lord, we must confess, we have sinned against Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and before thee, and are not worthy to be called thy Children: O make us thy Servants. There dwells no good thing in our Flesh; but sin is always present with us and our deeds are evil, and that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; but the power of thy Grace is able to subdue all things to it self. Do thou work in us both to will and to do of thy own good pleasure. Lord let not ours, but thy Will be done; and let it be done as it is in Heaven.

Bless our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign, make him a Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Father of thy Church; direct his Counsellors, and teach our Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Wisdom. Let Justice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be executed by all that are put in Authority; and let them not be a terror to good works, but to evil. Bless their endeavours that labour in thy Vineyard. Bless the people of these Kingdoms; teach them all to fear thy name, from the least to the greatest; and make them the happy people, that have the Lord for their God. Bless us also, bless us, O our Father, who commend our Souls and Bodies into thy hands. O remember not our former Iniquities, nor the Transgressions we have this day transgressed against thee. Spare us O Lord most holy, O God most mighty, O holy and most merciful

When thou givest us meat enough, we eat thy bread, and by our intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance or unthankfulness, we lift up our heel against thee; we slightly pass over thy Laws, despise thy San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and contemn thy Precepts; we trample upon thy Word, abuse thy Ordinances, and resist thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that should seal us to the day of Redemption. O who are we, that thy Spirit should strive with dust and ashes! that thou shouldst send thy Son, that we should not perish, and give him to die, that we might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain everlasting life; and deliver him to be wounded and bruised, to make us partakers of that fulness of Joy that is in thy presence, and those

O Lord, vouchsafe to add to all thy mercies, in creating a new heart, and renewing a right Spirit within us, and making us thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for all thy blessings. Teach us to deny ungodliness and worldly lust, to live righteously, soberly, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this present evil world; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for whatever troubles thou wilt lay upon us; fit us for Death and Judgment, and that great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we are one day to give, that whensoever thou shalt come, thou mayst find us so doing, that we may finally be received into the joys of thy rest.</p>

With the grace of thy holy Spirit sanctifie all his Sufferings, that he may turn and enquire after thee his God, before the evil day of death
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:37383:117"/> shall come, and make his peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he stand at thy Tribunal to be judged for all he has done in his mortal body. O holy Father, who art a God of the Spirits of all flesh, look in mercy on this thy Servant; lay upon him no more than thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablest him to bear; teach him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign his Will to thine, and by his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and submission to thy Will, to glorifie thee in this day of his Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. O Lord, we know that Man that is born of a Woman is not clean in thy sight; and if thou shouldst be extream to mark all that this thy Servant has done amiss, he could not answer thee one for a thousand; but thy mercies are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and thy compassion never fails; therefore for thy mercies sake, turn thy face away from his Iniquities, and blot out all his Transgressions; charge his Sins upon the score of thy Son, and let the hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances be nailed to the Cross, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:37383:118"/> so wash him in the blood of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Lamb, that his Sins that are as red as Scarlet, may be white as Snow.

O Lord heal his Soul, and then if it be thy good pleasure, his Body also; raise him up to praise thee once more in the land of the living, and make him so sensible that 'twas thy hand which gained the victory, that his mouth may shew forth thy praise, and declare the wonders that thou dost for the Children of Men, and his yet unfinished days make him more fit for the great day of accounts.

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>'TIS a sad Occasion of every good mans wonder and sorrow, to observe with what frivilous pretences men content themselves to excuse their repeated neglects of the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to see how the same persons that magnifie the Mystery, pretend Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to dispute themselves into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it, whilst at the same time they confess it a Duty and a Blessing. Some that value themselves upon the strictness of their Lives, pretend unworthiness from one Sacrament, nay, from one year to another; and yet make this which is so sad a testimony of their want of a due sense of Religion, a mark of their greater strictness; and with this wretched pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence how many resist all the Rhethorick
<pb facs="tcp:37383:127"/> and Reason of the Pulpit; defeat all the methods of entreaty and perswasion, and are deaf to all arguments to call them to the Table of the Lord? And at the same time that they blame others for denying the Cup to the People, they deny both Cup and Bread to themselves, and in their Barbarity to their own Souls, exceed the Cruelty they condemn. Never was there a sadder instance of a mis-led and deluded people! To awake men from this sad and deplorable State to a better sense of their Duty, and yet obviate the common Excuses of Ignorance of the Mystery, or unpreparedness, I shall enquire into the nature and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Blessed Sacrament, and lay down some Rules for a devout and pious preparation for it.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> What the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is: the Time and Ends of its Institution.</head>
                     <p>THE Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is a holy Mystery, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Christ as a Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and a Means both to represent and set forth his Death
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:37383:128"/> and sufferings, and confer a right to the Benefits thereof upon every wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicant.</p>
                     <p>That this Sacrament is a holy Rite or Mystery,<note place="margin">Sacrament a Mystery.</note> needs no further proof than the Confession of the whole Christian World, and the many Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about it, that have so long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted the Peace of Christendom; and all that name the name of Christ,<note place="margin">Ordain'd by Christ.</note> derive this Sacrament from his Will and Pleasure, and unanimously own, that 'tis from his Command and Practice, that the Observation of it becomes a Duty, and a Law, to all his Followers: His Command is Recorded by St. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. his Practice by him and two other of the Evangelists, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Mark</hi> 22.22. And the same Texts have (past all Controversie) made clear the time of its Institution;<note place="margin">Time of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</note> which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:37383:128"/> after the last Passover he eat with his Disciples, when the time drew nigh that the Son of Man was to be delivered into the hands of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men, to be crucified and slain. As for the ends and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Instituting this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mystery,<note place="margin">Ends of its Institution.</note> our Saviour himself will be our guide; and his Command, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> is proof enough, that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to perpetuate the memory of his Death and Sufferings, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. till his glorious Advent, or second coming to Judge the World. And that this Sacrament was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by our Saviour as a Seal of the Covenant of Grace,<note place="margin">Seal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</note> is likewise clear from his own words, which our Translations in <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. and 24. ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der New Testament; and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. &amp; 28. the New Testament in his Blood, which might as properly be rendred
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:37383:129"/> new Covenant, or the new Covenant in his Blood, being not only so tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated in those places by the learned <hi>Hammond,</hi> but the same word is so rendred by the same Translators in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8. and so these words of our Saviour, that is, the New Testament, or the new Covenant in my Blood will bear this Paraphrase, <hi>i. e.</hi> this is that Covenant of Grace and Mercy which God hath made with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and which shall shortly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and sealed unto them by the shedding of my Blood.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, that this sacred Mystery does confer upon every worthy Communicant, a right to the Benefits of our Saviour's Death and Sufferings, is as little to be questioned, as that Covenants among Men duly ratified and exchanged, do confer on the Covenanters a Right to the things co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted for. Being unwilling to tire the patience, or exceed the capacity or the time of common People, I
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:37383:129"/> shall add no more to this short and plain account of this Sacrament, but hasten to undeceive the careless and un-thinking Christian, by shewing him the necessity of this holy Duty in order to his salvation.</p>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:37383:130"/> of the Christian; I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not such a Necessity as would set bounds and limits to the mercy of God, or utterly exclude from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all such whom God has denyed a possibility of partaking in that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; nor such a necessity as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises from the Nature of the Work or Duty it self, without respect to the reason and end of its Institution, or the Will of the Institutor: But the necessity I speak of, is such as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises from the Will and Pleasure of Almighty God in making it the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Salvation is the Gift of God, and 'twas in his power to grant it unto men on what terms he pleased: Now he having thought fit to institute the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and command the usage of it, and in his Word to declare it one of the outward means of Salvation; We must expect Salvation in that, and in no other way, than that which God has appointed; and on no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:37383:131"/> Terms than those on which God has promised it. Consequently, the external participating of the Lords Supper is so necessary to that Salvation of the Christian, that without it Salvation is not in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner to be expected.</p>
                     <p>As for those to whom God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the ordinary means of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (his Word and Sacraments) we may say of them as the Apostle does in another case, <hi>what have we to do with them that are without?</hi> Nor will their Case afford better grounds for us to hope for Salvation, in the same way in which God may possibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it on them, than God's Care of <hi>Moses</hi> in the Mount, or of <hi>Elias</hi> in the Famine, to hope for a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous preservation of our Bodies, when there is no necessity for it; or that Ravens should feed us when we are blessed with plenty. Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, all such Persons, as live within the Bosom of such a Church
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:37383:131"/> as does require no manifestly sinful Terms of Communion, (if of Age and Capacity to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) they cannot neglect it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a manifest and apparent hazard of their Salvation. And this I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to be no other Doctrine than what God himself has taught us in the Holy Scripture, the proof of which I shall confine to such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as may be drawn from thence. As first, that it is necessary to our Union with Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sacrament means of Ʋnion with Christ.</note> That our Union with Christ is wrought, and continued by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Lords Supper, and that we are are thereby made one with Christ,<note place="margin">Communion Service.</note> and Christ with us; not our Holy Mother only, but the Holy Ghost has taught us. To this purpose is that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.17. <hi>We being many are one bread, and one body, for we all are parta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>s of that one bread:</hi>
                        <pb n="240" facs="tcp:37383:132"/> The Apostle here speaks of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, not only as a Symbol of Charity, and a means of uniting the Members of Christ to one another; but likewise as a means of Union unto <hi>Christ:</hi> For the Body with which we are there said to be united, and to be one, cannot be understood only of the Church, which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times styled the Body of <hi>Christ;</hi> and by union, with which we may be said to be united unto <hi>Christ;</hi> for as in the natural Body, the union of a particular Member to the Body, is the means by which it is united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Head: So it is in the Body spiritual, the union of a particular Member to the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is called his Body, is a means of uniting particular Members to <hi>Christ</hi> himself, who is said to be the Head of the Church. Nor is it to be doubted that the Sacrament, by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting us to this Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> his Church, does ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>y unite us unto
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:37383:132"/>
                        <hi>Christ;</hi> or that the words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle now mentioned will bear that sense; but besides this, this Text seems to import a higher and more immediate union, effected by a due receiving the blessed Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Because the Body with which we are here, by the Apostle said to be One, must be that he speaks of in the Verse preceding these Words, where he saith, <hi>The Bread which we break, is it not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Body of Christ?</hi> Where the Body spoken of seems to be the same which that Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. saith <hi>was broken,</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. saith was given for us, which can be understood of no other Body than that which was sacrificed on the Cross. Again, 'tis probable St. <hi>Paul</hi> used this Discourse chiefly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the converted Gentiles, not to eat of the Festival Sacrifices of the Idols they had forsaken, by shewing them the inconsistence of partaking
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:37383:133"/> of the Table of the Lord, and the Table of Devils; because, saith he, they that participate of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices offered to false Gods, do thereby partake of the nature of those Gods to which they sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the thing intimated in their having fellowship or communion with Devils, <hi>v.</hi> 20. and therefore you cannot partake of Idol-Sacrifices, and by partaking thereof become united unto, and partake of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Devils, and partake of the Table of the Lord, and by so doing, be united unto him, and participate of his pure and holy nature: For these are things so directly opposite, that to do both is impossible; and this seems the stress of the Apostles Argument. And that the reasoning of the Apostle was thus understood by the converted Gentiles, is highly probable; it being an Opinion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received among them, that union with their Gods, and partaking
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:37383:133"/> of the very nature of those <hi>Daemons,</hi> to which the Sacrifices were offered, was always the effect of eating of those Sacrifices that were offered to them. So that from this Discourse of the Apostle, who asserts partaking of the Cup of Blessing, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> v. 16. and eating of the Bread, communion of the body of <hi>Christ,</hi> there seems good grounds to conclude that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worthy Communicant, his parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Holy Sacrament, is not only a declarative Act of a political union with <hi>Christ,</hi> and all good <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;</hi> but likewise an effective means, by which a more immediate spiritual union betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and his own Soul is accomplished. And this is so high a Favour, so great a Blessing, that no one that tenders the good of his own Soul, would by his own fault be deprived of; and the benefits and necessity of this union, and of the holy Duty by
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:37383:134"/> which 'tis effected, will be further evident from the second thing to be considered, and that is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The vital Influence and saving Graces of God's holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are both conveyed unto good Christians, and cherished in them, and their spiritual Life preserved by a due participation of the Lord's Supper. As every member of the Body natural necessarily requires a Union with the Body; and being divided from, or deprived of those Spirits that animate the whole Body, does certainly perish, and lose its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life: so it is in the Body mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, if a Member be not united to it, or be deprived of the Graces that influence and animate that Body; it must cease to be a living Member of that Body mystical. At Baptism every Christian is made a Member of Christ, as our Church teaches us; and being so made, does not only suppose our Incorporation into the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:37383:134"/> Church, but likewise a participation of those Graces that are common to that Body; and without which we could not be Members of it: so that it is this spiritual Life, or our parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Graces of God's Spirit, that makes us living Members of Christ; and 'tis by vertue of our Union with Christ, and his Body the Church, by which at first we are made, and continued partakers of the Graces of God's Spirit; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he that refuses the means by which this Union is continued; that is, the means whereby he is made one Body with Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament, deprives himself of the vital Influences necessary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve him a living Member of Christ's Body. And that this is the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of neglecting the Sacrament, nothing will be more evident, if the words of St. <hi>John</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you,</hi>
                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:37383:135"/> will bear the Interpretation of the Ancients; who from thence so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asserted the indispensable necessity of the Lord's Supper, that they administred it to Infants, supposing their Salvation desperate if they died without it. And this was probably the reason why our Saviour was pleased to give us his Body and Blood under the Elements of Bread and Wine, the common nourishment of the natural Body; that he might thereby shew us the necessity, as well of strengthning and refreshing our Souls by his Body and Blood (as our Church speaks) as of our Bodies by Bread and Wine; and teach us that the spiritual Life of our Souls, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preserved without a frequent eating of our spiritual Food, no more than our Bodies can subsist without the Food that is natural. And how unreasonable is it to imagine, that those that are by nature and custom prone to do evil; that have created
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:37383:135"/> to themselves a necessity of sinning, should yet do well without constant supplies from the Fountain of Grace and Goodness, that works in us both to will and to do: or to expect this supply, and yet neglect the means by which God has promised and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to give it us; the sacred Mystery, the holy Jesus purposely contrived to maintain the principle of Life and Regeneration, that first he gives, when at Baptism he sets his Seal upon us and makes us his? And let it be considered, that without this we cannot be Children of God; and according to the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, &amp; 14. <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his;</hi> that we partake of this Spirit by being one with Christ; and are made one with Christ, and Christ with us, by being made one Bread, as the Apostle speaks. And from hence there will appear the same necessity of external partaking of the Lord's Supper, as of partaking of that Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi>
                        <pb n="248" facs="tcp:37383:136"/> without which we are none of his. I might further urge the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from what our Saviour saith of abiding in the Vine, <hi>John</hi> 15.4. in order to our bearing Fruit; or that of <hi>John</hi> 6.53. which the Church of God for some Ages understood of the Sacrament; but because these of late have been considered at large by a better hand, I shall therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, to shew the indispensable neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the blessed Sacrament, by shewing Thirdly, how a due parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof, does intitle to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of <hi>Christ's</hi> Death, his Passion and Resurrection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments urged by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sacrament inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to Christ<hi>'s</hi> Death, Passion and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> as proof of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of our Bodies, to Glory and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, are the Union betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and his Members, and their being quickned by the same Spirit. <hi>Christ</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>was the first fruits
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:37383:136"/> of them that slept,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.20. and hence <hi>v.</hi> 23. concludes the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of those that are his; and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> And as the Spirit is only promised in the Covenant of Grace, so the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of giving it, is to such only as are careful to enter into, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the condition of that Covenant. Therefore that which gives a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and well-grounded Assurance of God's performing to each Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in particular, the conditions of this Covenant, is his own care to make himself a party in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by sealing of it; and thereby tying himself to perform the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the same; consequently the sealing of this Covenant, being the way that God has appointed to make each Christian a party to it,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:37383:137"/> must be as necessary to intitle him to the Benefits of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Death and Passion, the things on God's part co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted for, as the sealing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering a Bond or Covenant among Men, is to give a legal Right to the things in that Bond or Covenant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned for. And this will be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evident from the next thing to be considered, That the partaking of this Sacrament, is the way that God has appointed to apply and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to particular Christians, what he has in general promised in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>
                     <p>

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:37383:137"/> every man;</hi> and not thinking this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough out of his tenderness and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to poor Sinners, he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a way to admit them into this Covenant, and to give to every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinner in particular, repeated assurances of enjoying the Benefits thereof; and therefore not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Sacrament of Baptism to admit us into this Covenant du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our Minority, but the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, by which this Covenant might be personally sealed by every Sinner; and God seal to every Sinner those Blessings in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral promised. Now these being the ends for which these holy Rites were instituted; he that at Baptism is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into this Covenant by virtue of a Promise (made by others in his Name) to observe the Conditions of it: If he refuse when he comes of Age to ratifie this Covenant, and by sealing it to make himself a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to it, and take upon him the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:37383:138"/> to perform the Conditions it requires; he has no more reason to expect the Benefits of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, than Minors to expect the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a Contract made for them by their Guardians, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, come to Age, refuse to confirm. Therefore such Persons as wilfully refuse to come to the Lord's Table, and thereby personally to own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obliged to perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions required on man's part in the Covenant of Grace, ought to be looked upon as such as do renounce that Covenant, and all the Benefits of their <hi>Christianity,</hi> and have no more reason to expect advantage from the Gospel Covenant, than from any other Contract in which they are not concerned. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is a Danger little regarded, because little understood, and this Argument cannot be urged too far, or made too plain; pardon me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if I take leave to explain it by
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:37383:138"/> asking a Question or two that may make the thing more plain. Suppose a lawful Government should contrive a solemn League and Covenant, and enjoin every one to take that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that did expect the benefits and protection of that Government, and command that Parents should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for their Children during their Minority, but when grown to years of discretion, that then every Person should come into a Court of Judicature, or a Congregation, and with lifted up hands personally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to observe the conditions of that Covenant; now suppose some Persons born whilst this was a Law of the Kingdom, and in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that Law, their Parents undertook for them during their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority; yet when grown up to be Men, these Persons would by no means be prevailed upon to come personally and promise to observe it; but tho the Magistrate comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:37383:139"/> and the Minister invited, yet still refused: let me ask now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the promise made by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in their behalf, be enough to intitle them to the benefits of the Covenant; or rather, whether this refusal in their own persons, to take this Covenant, be not a just reason for all men to conclude, they expect no manner of Advantage from it, but that they totally renounce it, and all the benefits thereof? Let me beg of those poor mis-led People that neglect the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, to apply this to themselves. God has made a Covenant with Mankind, and has required that we not only promise Obedience to it by our Sponsors during our minority, but that every one (when of Age) shall in his own Person seal this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and personally promise in and by that Ordinance (which he has instituted for that very end) to observe the Conditions of it. What
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:37383:139"/> reason then can any man have to hope for the benefits of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that does refuse to seal it? Nay, on the contrary, is there not the highest reason to conclude, such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal to be an actual renouncing of the Gospel-covenant; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently such an act as renders the Refusers utterly incapable of the blessing of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and all the merit and mercies of a Saviour, and puts them in as bad, if not a worse state than some honest <hi>Pagans</hi> are in; it being better not to know, than to know, and yet to despise the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a Saviour. Again, there was a Covenant betwixt God, and the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was confirmed to them by a Sacrifice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. But when any Proselyte was admitted into that Church, before he could have any right to the benefits of that Covenant, there was required a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice from him, which was called
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:37383:140"/> an Applicatory Sacrifice; by vertue of which, the Covenant in general made with that People, was sealed to particular Proselytes: This Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was a Type of that which God hath made with mankind, and the Sacrifice by which it was confirmed, of that Sacrifice by which God has confirmed the Gospel-covenant; that full, perfect and sufficient Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Communion Service.</note> Oblation and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the Sins of the whole World, made by our Saviour on the Cross. Now because 'tis not possible that this Sacrifice should be repeated; for <hi>Christ</hi> can die no more nor is it necessary that it should be repeated, because as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Heb,</hi> 10.12, 14, 18. <hi>This Man after he had offered one Sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of God, and by one offering, hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for ever them that are sanctified: and where there is remission, there is no more offering for sin.</hi> Therefore what
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:37383:140"/> remains, is, that there should be a second kind of Sacrifice among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to answer to the Applicatory Sacrifice among the Jews; and this can be no other than that Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical federal Sacrifice, by which the merit and efficacy of the Sacrifice of <hi>Christ,</hi> is applied to every Christian; and the Covenant made with all, is ratified with every single Believer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Besides all this,<note place="margin">Dishonour to neglect it.</note> how great a dishonour is it to our Saviour, and his Gospel, to imagine, that He who came on purpose to redeem us from the Jewish Yoak, and give us such a Religion as might be a reasonable Service, should ever appoint this as a standing and perpetual Duty, if he did not think it necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? And that the Apostles, the Primitive Christians, and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom (excepting a few mis-guided men in this last Century) did, and still do, apprehend it a necessary,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:37383:141"/> tho an ordinary means of Salvation, is as manifest as their usage of it, or as that there is the face of a Christian Church in the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And if any stress may be put on a Parable, from the Sentence pronounced on those that made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses for not coming to the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Feast, 'tis manifest our Saviour intended that this Sacrament should be thought thus necessary: And that he will pronounce them unworthy to tast of his Supper, that will not come when they are bidden. And certainly, the only reason of that dreadful Sentence against him that came in to the Feast without a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment, was the very same Offence that they are charged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that did neglect it; that is, he was unworthy to tast of his Supper: And if the guilt be the same in the negligent and the unworthy, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>

                        <note place="margin">Conclusion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending duty to practice.</note> It remains therefore that I beseech every <hi>Christian</hi> by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his own Soul, that whilst he is careful not to intrude on the Lord's Supper, and come without a Wedding Garment, he be as careful, lest he injure his own Soul by his neglect thereof; and by his refusal, provoke his Lord to that heavy Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>he is unworthy to tast of my Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> Let no little excuses serve thy turn, but have a care lest by ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less scruples thou destroy that for which <hi>Christ</hi> dyed. Will a neat and well dressed Apology, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of thy Clothes, keep thee warm without them! Or when thou art hungry, canst thou charm thy Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite by magnifying the danger of a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:37383:142"/> Surfeit? and contentedly starve thy self for fear thou shouldst dye with eating? And wilt thou be thus sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage and barbarous to thy own Soul, in a thing that so nearly concerns thy welfare; and refuse the passionate Invitation of thy Lord, to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most mysterious union, even that by which thou art made one with <hi>Christ?</hi> Wilt thou refuse that Sacred Banquet God has provided at the price of the Death and Sufferings of his eternal Son, and designed on purpose to seal thy pardon and peace? Remember then as oft as thou art tempted to a neglect of this Duty, at once thou slightest the highest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a Saviours Love, and one of the greatest Blessings that God vouchsafed unto Mankind: Thou robbest thy self of a Mercy, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyest a Command, thy Saviour purchased and sealed with his Blood. Therefore let every Christian as he tenders his eternal welfare, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:37383:142"/> the Command and dearest Pledge of a Saviour's Love, or the necessities of his own Soul, resolve never to turn his Back on the Table of the Lord; but as often as thy Lord invites thee to this Table, and thou art beseeched in Christ stead by those that attend upon his Service, make no excuses, but come and be reconciled unto God. And now that he who has appointed this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his Charity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, and commanded us to come in, that his Table may be filled, may accept thee, I shall enlarge to shew what preparation is requisite to make a devout and worthy Communicant</p>

                        <p>This was the last pledge of my Saviours Love, the last attempt of a dying Charity, to transmit the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and the benefits of his Death;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:37383:144"/> to Seal the pardon he promises in his Gospel, and dyed to purchase, to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the peace he has made with our once angry Father: an uncommon Banquet, such as may provoke, if not the envy, yet the wonder of Angels; a refection provided at the expence of Miracles, and in the whole progress speaks nothing else but Mystery: No Water turned to Wine, but which is more amazing, Wine consecrated into Blood; even that Blood which is Drink indeed: No multiplyed Loaves to feed Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, but a Body that is Meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; an Antepast to the Seraphick Feasts of Charity, and the Delicacies of his glorious Kingdom: And must I be tyed by Laws, forced by Threats and Sanctions? Must I be compelled to come in, that this Table may be filled? Why do I draw back? Why do I tremble to put my Hand in the Dish? Why does mine, like <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> hand, shake whilst the Cup is
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:37383:145"/> there? Were all this the product of Humility; were it a sense of those Indignities with which I have so often abused the goodness and mercies of Heaven, I might still hope better from the Impartial Master of the Feast, than the harsh, but just Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of, <hi>Bind him Hand and Foot for utter Darkness.</hi> But is it not some secret League with his avowed Foes, that pulls back my Hand from the Table of the holy Jesus? Is it not some darling sin, some flattering Lust that keeps me back from the Altar of my God? Have not I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued Vanity, and lifted my Hands to strange Gods? And is it not this that strikes Convulsions there? Alas! this Trembling is the issue of my Guilts, and this is the true cause why I stand in need of compulsion to bring me in: Here lies the Christians malady, 'tis the disorders of his Soul which create a disgust to the viands of Heaven, and make him tremble

                        <p>WHat a mixture of Fear and Joy invades my Soul, when I look back on the great Mystery that now is past! what amazement strikes shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering through my Veins, when I dare to remember, that I have feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my God, yet still do live! that by a mystery secret and inscru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, I have tasted that Blood that
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:37383:168"/> was shed from the foundation of the World; that the dear effects of all my Saviour's Agonies, the Sacred purchase of his Passion, are bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a wretched and undeserving miscreant; my Prince has vouchsafed to receive a Rebel to his Favour; my Father a Prodigal to his Arms: and my God, a sinner to his Mercy. Good God! what is Man, that thus thou art mindful of him, and the Son of Man, that thus thou regardest him! What is there in sinful Dust and Ashes, to invite thy Goodness, or fix thy Love? Can there be charms in misery, or any thing amiable in wretched Clay? Or can ingratitude or demerit plead a right to Love? What then shall I give unto the Lord for all the benefits that he hath done unto me! I have already taken the Cup of Salvation, that did not pay, but help to enhanse the Debt.</p>
                        <p>I will therefore call upon the name of the Lord, and pay my Vows;
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:37383:169"/> since he has vouchsafed a Cure, I will endeavour to sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto me; my Life shall be one protracted Song of praise: And that those sins I have divorced may return no more, a sedulous care shall be my Guard, a constant ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration shall be my Sacrifice, and the holy Offices of a devout Life, the Retribution that my succeeding mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes shall be sequestred to pay; and I will endeavour, that a Victory over my passions may laud the Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of my Saviour's Death; that a conquest over my Lusts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensities to sin, may speak the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and power of his Passion, and speak me a worthy partaker of that heavenly Feast celebrated in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him.</p>
